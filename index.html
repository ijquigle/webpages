           <p>Hi, my name is Jake and I'm a freshman. My intended major is Aerospace engineering.
              I have always had a passion for space and building things,
              so to combine these interests, I chose this major.
        	</p>
        	<br />
        	<p> I'm currently a lifeguard at a YMCA and a swim coach during the summers.
        		I've always been comfortable in an aquatic environment, so most of my jobs
        		have been around the pool. I have also taught individual swim lessons, but
        		stopped because I dislike kids.
        	</p>
